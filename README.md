PackForge is a pipeline app for the creation of digital 3D products to be sold on marketplaces.

The app consists of a desktop application for main operations and a Maya shelf that loads when a Maya scene is opened from the desktop app. The shelf lets the user export the assets so that they can be manually imported in Unreal Engine.

Its creation proved necessary to reduce production time by automating repetitive tasks, thereby guaranteeing artists maximum creative freedom without interruptions or slowdowns.
